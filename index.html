                                kitchen on the 26th of September 1976 seven musicans took part in what would be the bands first practice and 
                                the name of band was 'Feedback'. By 1978 the band which had gone through two name changes to 'Hype' and then 
                                finally U2 was down to the four that we know today Bono on vocals, the Edge on guitar, Adam Clayton on base 
                                and Larry Mullins Jr on drums. Despite building a solid reputation locally U2 struggled to get a record deal 
                                until finally in 1979 they signed with Island records and the rest as they say was history!

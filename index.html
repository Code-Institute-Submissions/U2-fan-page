                <p class="started-content"> 1976 Larry Mullens posted a notice in his school saying 'musicians wanted' to form a band. So in Larry's 
                kitchen on the 26th of September 1976 seven musicans took part in what would be the bands first practice and 
                the name of band was 'Feedback'. By 1978 the band which had gone through two name changes to 'Hype' and then 
                finally U2 was down to the four that we know today Bono on vocals, the Edge on guitar, Adam Clayton on base 
                and Larry Mullins Jr on drums. Despite building a solid reputation locally U2 struggled to get a record deal 
                until in 1979  U2 played a show at the 2,000-seat National Stadium in Dublin as part of an Irish tour. Although they 
                took a significant risk in booking a venue of that size, the move paid off. Bill Stewart, an A&R representative for 
                Island Records, was in attendance and subsequently signed the group to the label and the rest as they say was history!
